    Shared between all instances of the class (because they are static), and
    Immutable â€” they cannot be changed (because they are const).
    So even though they are public, no code outside the class can modify them.
    Keeping them public makes the code cleaner and more readable, and allows easy access to these constant values, which represent the fixed grade requirements of the form. */
